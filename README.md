# QMK Keymap

This repository contains the keymaps for all the QMK-enabled keyboards i have.
I took the design of the repo from [this article](https://medium.com/@patrick.elmquist/separate-keymap-repo-for-qmk-136ff5a419bd).

## Keyboards

- Aurora Sweep

## Building Keymap

To build all keymaps use:

```sh
make all
```

To build a specific keymap use:

```sh
make aurora
```

## TODO

- Kyria rev3 build
- Chocofi build
